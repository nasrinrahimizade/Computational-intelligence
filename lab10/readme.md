I used Colab for doing this lab and the last time I checket the format was good. Eventhe in the issues I received they told the code is well organized but I do't know why it is in a wrong format. anyway I will reupload it in lab10v2.ipynb .
I also want to mention that for doing this code I searched a lot of websites and used some ideas in them.
